# Ophthalmic health and well-being application
## Outline
An AI-powered application for android phones that predicts a user’s eyesight level based on their performance on a series of interactive visual tests; for example, colour differentiation, letter/shape recognition, and visual acuity challenges. The app will collect the response data from these tests like accuracy, response time, distance calibration, and the AI model will use that data to predict the user’s eyesight level. The application will simply provide a predicted result and the user will be suggested to see the nearest eye doctor. The application will also contain a map which will navigate the user to nearest eye clinics or hospitals.
